<h2>5 Types of branches</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Master branch</strong>-the master branch is the production branch. The code living in the master branch
		is what the running product has. </li>
	<li><strong>Release branch</strong>-the release branch is pulled from the master branch. The release branch is the
		branch where the code is pushed to when ready for release. This is where the code lives before it makes it
		to production. Additional unit testing is run on code on this branch. </li>
	<li><strong>Hotfix branch</strong>-the hotfix branch is pulled from master branch. The purpose of the hotfix branch
		is to fix issues in production in a quick manner without a sprint. This branch is only used it's an occasion
		of a urgent issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Develop branch</strong>-the develop branch is pulled from the master branch. The develop branch is the
		branch where any code that has been developed in the current sprint lives. This is code meant for the next
		release but is not ready for release yet. </li>
	<li><strong>Feature branch</strong>-the feature branch is pulled from the development branch. The feature branch
		is where the development of the code happens. A feature branch is used per feature.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>A ticket process</h2>
<ol>
	<li>First you will need your ticket for the feature that is being worked on. </li>
	<li>Checkout master branch.
		By default you should be on master branch unless if switched to a different branch. </li>
	<li>Do a git fetch and git pull in order to pull exact code from master into local.</li>
	<li>Checkout develop branch.</li>
	<li>Do a git fetch and git pull in order to ensure code on develop branch is up to date with code on master.  </li>
	<li>Checkout a new branch. The newly created branch is considered a feature branch and will branch out
		out from develop.  </li>
	<li>New branch will have the code from develop up to this point</li>
	<li>Coding can not begin on feature branch. </li>
	<li>Once feature has been completed and ready to be tested, merge feature branch into development branch. </li>
	<li>If no merge conflicts occured, code should have successfully joined the code in develop./li>
	<li>Testing will occur on develop branch.</li>
	<li>Once feature is verified to be ready for production, develop branch is merged into release branch.</li>
	<li>Once code is on release branch, additional testing is done to verify code is absolutely ready to be in production.</li>
	<li>Now release branch will be merged into master branch.</li>
	<li>Master branch will now have the new code.</li>
	<li>If any P1 issues occur that NEED to be fixed asap, a new branch is pulled from master branch in order to
	crate a hotfix branch and fix the code.</li>
	<li>When code on hotfix branch has been tested and accepted, hotfix branch will be merged into master branch.</li>
</ol>
